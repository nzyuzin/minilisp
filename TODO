Primitives.global_context should return new context each time. It will help to
avoid having undesirable pollution of global context between runs

Make `and`, `or` to be special forms in eval instead of functions as it's
implemented now. The problem of the current approach is that according to
normal way of function application, the arguments are always evaluated. That's
not expected of logical operators however. Therefore, the special form should
allow us to evaluate operands of `and` and `or` only when it's needed.
